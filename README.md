## Advanced Strategies

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

The MACD indicator helps traders identify potential buy and sell signals. It shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

### Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands. They help traders identify overbought or oversold conditions.

### KDJ (Stochastic Oscillator)

The KDJ indicator combines the stochastic oscillator with a momentum indicator. It helps identify potential reversals in the market.

### EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

The EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. It's useful for identifying trends.

The Crypto MCP Server supports integration with various exchanges. Currently, we support:

- **Binance**
